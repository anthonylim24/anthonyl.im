# anthonyl.im — Impeccable Design Context

This repo hosts three distinct experiences under one shell: a personal AI chatbot, the **BreathFlow** wellness app, and the **Korea Trip** itinerary app. Each has its own visual identity; all share the underlying craft principles below.

## Shared Design Principles (apply to every route)

1. **Craft over convention.** Prefer custom, considered solutions over generic component-library defaults. Spacing, typography weight contrast, surface hierarchy, and motion should feel intentionally designed, not assembled.
2. **Motion with purpose.** Every animation should serve comprehension (orient, reveal, guide) or affect (calm, anticipation, delight). Decorative-only motion is rejected. Spring physics over linear tweens; respect `prefers-reduced-motion` everywhere.
3. **Depth through restraint.** No more than one vivid moment per viewport. Use neutral mass to make accents punch. Avoid glassmorphism stacking, gradient text on headings, and generic SaaS gradients.
4. **Typography as the design language.** Cormorant Garamond for display moments, Inter for body. Weight + size + tracking carry the hierarchy — let the type breathe.
5. **One accent, many neutrals.** Each app gets a single signature accent; the rest of the palette stays disciplined.

## Shared Accessibility Standards

- **Target:** WCAG AA (4.5:1 contrast, keyboard navigation, screen-reader support)
- **Reduced motion:** All transforms / pulses / orbital rotations must honor `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Touch targets:** Minimum 44 × 44 px for all interactive elements
- **Focus indicators:** Visible focus rings on every interactive element (route-specific accent color)
- **ARIA:** Live regions, proper roles, and explicit labels on every dynamic surface (breathing orb, Map Mode bubbles, status banners)
- **i18n:** No layouts that break on long Korean / hangul strings; copy uses `break-words` + `overflow-wrap:anywhere` defensively

## Shared Tech Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 8
- Tailwind CSS 4.2 + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives)
- Zustand (state), Motion (animation), Lucide (icons)
- Bun + Hono (server), Clerk (auth), Supabase (sync), PostHog (analytics)
- Three.js (Korea Map Mode only)

## Design Context: `/` and `/chatbot` — Personal AI Chatbot

### Users
Visitors who land on `anthonyl.im` directly. Recruiters, prospective collaborators, friends, curious engineers. They're trying to get a feel for who Anthony is — fast. They scan, they pivot, they leave if it doesn't earn attention.

### Brand Personality
**Quiet, Confident, Crafted.** A staff-engineer's personal site — minimal but not lazy, technical but not cold. The interface should feel like meeting someone who answers questions thoughtfully rather than performing for an audience.

**Emotional goal:** A reassuring "this person ships" feeling. The chatbot is the demo.

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Theme:** Light-first warm parchment with a subtle grain overlay (SVG fractal noise). Dark mode inverts to the same `#171613` canvas.
- **Surface:** Two-tone — a warm canvas with a single column for chat content. No nested cards.
- **Accent:** Warm amber `#B8860B`, only on send action + suggested-question pills.
- **Anti-references:** No purple "AI" gradients. No glowing borders. No "AI typing" indicator with rainbow lights. Stay quiet.

### Per-route Tokens
- Theme class switch: `chatbot-shadow` for light, `chatbot-dark` for dark
- Grain texture is a *design feature* — keep it
- 100dvh container so iOS safe areas blend with `html { background: #F5F2ED }`

## Design Context: `/breathwork/*` — BreathFlow

### Users
Wellness enthusiasts and people seeking anxiety / stress relief. They open BreathFlow when they need to decompress, build a daily breathing habit, or access structured breathwork techniques backed by science. The context is often evening wind-down, pre-performance calm, or mid-day stress breaks — moments that demand a UI that feels immediately calming upon launch.

### Brand Personality
**Calm, Scientific, Premium.** Like a high-end wellness lab — trustworthy, refined, evidence-based. The interface should feel like a precision instrument for the body, not a toy. Gamification (XP, levels, achievements) exists to sustain habit, not to entertain — it's motivation architecture, not playfulness.

**Emotional goals:** Immediate calm (like stepping into a quiet room — tension drops instantly) and quiet confidence (like a deep breath before a big moment — grounded and capable).

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Visual tone:** Warm parchment + ink. Light-first with a warm beige canvas (`#F5F2ED`), ink typography (`#1C1917`), amber accent (`#B8860B`).
- **References:** Calm / Headspace's wellness credibility combined with Arc / Linear's craft. More technical than mainstream wellness, warmer than dev tools.
- **Anti-references:** No SaaS purple, no cartoon-illustrated wellness, no cluttered dashboards.

### Per-route Tokens

| Token | Light | Dark | Usage |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| Accent | `#B8860B` | `#C9A227` | Primary interactive |
| Success | `#6B8F71` | `#8DAF92` | Personal bests |

#### Technique Colors (muted, calming)

| Technique | Primary | Secondary |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Box Breathing | `#8B7355` | `#A89278` |
| CO2 Tolerance | `#6B8F71` | `#8DAF92` |
| Power Breathing | `#A0654E` | `#BF826B` |
| Cyclic Sighing | `#7B8794` | `#99A5B2` |

### BreathFlow-specific Principles

1. **Serenity first.** Every design decision should reduce visual noise. White space is a feature.
2. **Scientific credibility.** Typography, data visualization, and content should convey authority — the app teaches real breathwork protocols.
3. **The orb is sacred.** The breathing orb is the product. Animation of the orb must be flawless and physics-accurate; surrounding UI fades out during session.
4. **Habit > novelty.** Gamification exists to drive return visits. Never let the motivational layer overpower the breathwork itself.

## Design Context: `/korea/*` — Korea Trip Itinerary

### Users
Anthony (primary) and his partner, while planning + executing a 12-day Seoul + Busan trip in late May / early June 2026. Used on phones for in-trip lookups (reservations, places nearby, directions) and on desktop for planning. Authenticated behind Clerk so it's a private dossier.

### Brand Personality
**Cinematic, Personal, Refined.** A private travel concierge dossier — every reservation accounted for, every neighborhood researched, every recommendation reasoned. Map Mode is the centerpiece: a 3D orbital view where YOU sit at the center of the trip universe.

**Emotional goals:** Anticipation (the trip is coming, every piece feels considered) and confidence (no detail slips through). Should feel like a hand-bound itinerary booklet animated into the future.

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Visual tone:** Warm parchment base inherited from the shared palette, with a **rose / amber gradient bloom** as the signature. Korea's red-and-gold heritage referenced without literal kitsch — no taegukgi flag chrome, but the spirit of it.
- **Hero gradient:** soft rose top-left → amber bottom-right radial blobs (animated, slow drift). Dark mode swaps to a purple / indigo / mauve nightscape so in-trip evening lookups feel travel-time-of-day appropriate.
- **Glass orbs (Map Mode):** `MeshPhysicalMaterial` with `transmission: 0.7`, frosted `roughness`, `clearcoat`, subtle `iridescence`. Inner billboard plane carries the place's Wikipedia photo so it appears refracted through the glass. Fresnel rim shell adds an additive edge glow.
- **YOU pin:** CSS-anchored to viewport center, independent of camera projection. The camera orbits *around* YOU.
- **References:** Apple Maps' Look Around isometry combined with the small careful detail work of `flighty.app` and the editorial restraint of `monocle.com/travel`.
- **Anti-references:** Cluttered booking aggregators (Booking.com), generic "trip planner" SaaS dashboards, kitsch tourism brochures, OpenStreetMap defaults.
- **Theme:** Both light and dark are first-class — light during planning, dark for in-trip evening lookups.

### Per-route Tokens

| Token | Light | Dark | Usage |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| Accent — primary | `#F43F5E` (rose-500) | `#FB7185` (rose-400) | Scheduled reservations, YOU pin, primary CTAs |
| Accent — secondary | `#F59E0B` (amber-500) | `#FBBF24` (amber-400) | Core itinerary items, hero gradient stop |
| Accent — supplemental | `#A8A29E` (stone-400) | `#78716C` (stone-500) | Supplemental / extras in Map Mode |
| Success | `#10B981` (emerald-500) | `#34D399` (emerald-400) | Confirmed booking status |
| Pending | `#F59E0B` (amber-500) | `#FBBF24` (amber-400) | Reservation pending |
| Glass orb base | per-place category color | same | `MeshPhysicalMaterial` color tint |

### Korea-specific Principles

1. **YOU is the geometric + visual center.** The Map Mode camera orbits the user — never drifts. The CSS-anchored YOU label is non-negotiable; perspective rotates *around* it.
2. **Refraction over flat fill.** Where reasonable, prefer materials that refract (glass orbs, frosted overlays) over solid shapes. The trip should feel three-dimensional, not pasted on.
3. **Distance is information, not chrome.** Every place card / orb label surfaces distance + walking ETA prominently as a colored pill — it's the most-used piece of data, not a footnote.
4. **Smart links everywhere.** Flight numbers → carrier tracker, KTX → Korail timetable, addresses → Google Maps, phones → `tel:`, times → AM/PM tooltip. Free-form copy gets auto-linked by the `LinkifiedText` engine.
5. **PWA auto-update is mandatory.** Service worker + client must auto-swap to the latest version after each deploy — users should never see stale Map Mode. Bump `CACHE_VERSION` on every breaking SW change.

### Map Mode-specific Conventions

- Camera target = world origin
- Default pitch ≈ 0.78 rad (top-down isometric)
- All bubbles on the same `y = 1.6` plane (depth comes from camera angle, not staggered elevations — the user wants YOU as the unambiguous center)
- No auto-rotate — scene stays still until dragged
- Camera radius adapts per viewport (62 → 30 from 320 px → 1440 px)
- Reset-view crosshair button restores yaw / pitch / radius
- WebGL fallback: styled list view with the same filter chip bar + photo thumbnails

## Cross-app Components Worth Knowing

- **`<LinkifiedText>`** (Korea) — universal smart-linker. Detects flight numbers (UA / KE / OZ / AA / DL / AS / BA / JL / NH), KTX trains, Korean phones (+82), emails, URLs, Korean street addresses (`-daero` / `-ro` + `-gil`), subway exit references, and 24-hour times (which become hover-tooltip AM/PM via `<Time>`).
- **`<ReservationCard>`** (Korea) — status pill (✅ / 🟡 / 🔴), category icon, time with AM/PM tooltip, chip row for Maps / Call / Book.
- **`<DayCard>`** + **`<DayTreeNav>`** (Korea) — city-tinted gradients, spring entry, today-detection ring.
- **`<MapModeScene>`** (Korea) — Three.js orbital scene with the conventions above. CSS YOU pin anchors center.
- **`<KstClock>`** (Korea) — live Asia/Seoul time pill in the tree nav.

## Service Worker / Caching Contract

The app is a PWA. Every deploy must keep these invariants:

- **`/sw.js`** served with `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` + `Service-Worker-Allowed: /`
- **SPA HTML** served with `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
- **`/assets/*`** content-hashed bundles served with `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- **`CACHE_VERSION`** in `sw.js` MUST be bumped on every SW-behavior change
- The client (`serviceWorker.ts`) posts `SKIP_WAITING` and reloads on `controllerchange` — gives users seamless updates without a manual hard refresh
